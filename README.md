## Usage
Check under the *build* folder, the compiled apk is already bundled there. Simply install and enjoy.

## Scope
Please note that the app is still under works and is not completed yet. Check back later for update, simply star the project to automatically receive updates.

## Build
This is a pure expo app, simply clone the project, ensure you have **expo** installed and in your path scope, simply run the following in the root app folder
```shell
npm install 
npm start
```

Expo's dev tools web page will come up afterwards, you can then view the app via your expo client on any android or IPhone. Simple and easy. Lemme know if you run into any issues getting this up and running.
See [What's Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) to know what expo means.
